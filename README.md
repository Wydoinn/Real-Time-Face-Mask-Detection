# Real Time Face Mask Detection

Face mask detection system using machine learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This system will analyze live video streams or recorded video to identify whether individuals are wearing face masks or not. By leveraging the power of deep learning, it aims to enhance safety and compliance with mask-wearing protocols in various environments, such as public spaces and healthcare settings.
